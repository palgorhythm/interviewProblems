// you're in charge of preparing a recently purchased lot for one of amazon's new buildings.
// the lot is covered with tranches and has a single obstacle that needs to be
// taken down before the foundation can be prepared for the building.
// the demolition robot must remove the obstacle before progress can be made on the building.

//write an algorithm to determine the minimum distance required for the demolition robot to remove the obstacle.

// assumptions:
//* the lot is flat, except for trenches, and can be represented as a 2D grid.
//* the robot must start from the top left corner of the lot, which is always flat
//* and can move one block up, down, left, or right per move.
//* the robot can't enter trenches and can't leave the lot.
//* the flat areas are represented by a 1, the trenches by 0, and the obstacle by 9.

//! constraints: 1 <= numRows, numColumns <= 1000000000

//? example input:
const lot = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 9, 1]]; //! expected output: 3

const lot1 = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0]]; //! expected: -1

const lot2 = [[1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 9, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]]; // 5
